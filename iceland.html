<h2 class="center">Iceland</h2>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/icelandmap.jpg" alt="map of Iceland" title="map of Iceland"><p>Iceland is known as a geothermal wonder, with its hot springs and geysers. The country
	is beautiful to visit year-round; however, your experiences may be drastically different
	depending on what time of year you visit. For example, when visiting over the summer, you
	could experience days with up to 21 hours of sunlight, versus a winter visit where you
	could only experience up to 5 hours of sunlight on any given day. Visiting in the winter
	with the lack of sunlight contributes to it also being known as a great place to see the
	Northern Lights.

	<br><br>

	Reykjavik is its capital city and where many of its attractions originate. Within
	Reykjavik, it would be worthwhile to sign up for a walking tour to explore the city. Another
	option for exploring further outside of the city is to sign up for a bus tour to adventure
	out to more of the geothermal wonders.
	
	<br><br>
	
	<strong>Alex's Atlas Travel Insights:</strong>
	<br>
	Dublin, Ireland is only a 2.5 hour flight from Reykjavik, Iceland. If you are
	looking to explore more of the world during your trip, consider adding a
	<a href=ireland.html>trip to Ireland</a> to your itinerary.

<h3 class="center" id="glacier"><span>Glacier Hike</span><span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/glacier.jpg" alt="group on the glacier hike by a glacial waterfall" title="glacier hike by a glacial waterfall"><p>If you have ever wanted to hike on a glacier, Iceland is the place to do it.
	A <a href="https://adventures.is/iceland/day-tours/glacier-tours/" target="_blank">
	Glacier Tour</a> is one of the most exciting activities. This is a guided tour where
	safety equipment (e.g., crampons for your boots) is provided. Even when visiting in the
	summer, it is recommended to bring warm attire for the glacier. If you are lucky, you
	may even have an opportuity to drink fresh water while on your hike.
		
	<br><br>
	
	<strong>Alex's Atlas Travel Insights:</strong>
	<br>
	If you enjoy hiking and are looking for a new hiking challenge to look forward to,
	consider visiting <a href=japan.html#fuji>Mount Fuji</a> in Japan.

<h3 class="center" id="gullfoss">Gullfoss Waterfall<span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/gullfoss.jpg" alt="Gullfoss Waterfall with rainbow" title="Gullfoss Waterfall"><p>The <a href="https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/gullfoss" target="_blank">
	Gullfoss Waterfall</a>, also known as the "Golden Falls", provides an awe-inspiring
	landscape. It is one of the main attractions on any Golden Circle tour offered in Iceland.</p></div>
	
<h3 class="center" id="blacksand">Black Sand Beach<span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/blacksand.jpg" alt="Black Sand Beach with rocks offshore" title="Black Sand Beach"><p>The Reynisfjara <a href="https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/reynisfjara" target="_blank">
	Black Sand Beach</a> is a magnificent sight to behold. Its black sand was formed
	from hot lava. The beach is found in Iceland's South Coast and can be visited as part of most
	bus tours that highlight Iceland's beautiful South Coast. Another geological wonder that can be 
	spotted at the beach is its towering basalt columns.</p></div>
	
<h3 class="center" id="goldencircle">Golden Circle<span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/goldencirclethingvellir.jpg" alt="Thingvellir National Park, tectonic plates meeting" title="Thingvellir National Park, tectonic plates meeting"><p>Iceland's <a href="https://guidetoiceland.is/best-of-iceland/top-9-detours-on-the-golden-circle" target="_blank">
	Golden Circle</a> is a compilation of a few major attractions in Iceland. This includes
	Thingvellir National Park, The Geysir Geothermal Area, and Gullfoss Waterfall (mentioned above).
	Together, these attractions provide insight into Iceland's geological and geothermal history. The
	Golden Circle can easily be visited as part of a guided bus tour or visited by car.</p></div>
		
<h3 class="center" id="church">Hallgrímskirkja Church<span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/hallgrimskirkja.jpg" alt="Hallgrimskirkja Church" title="Hallgrimskirkja Church"><p>When visiting Reykjavik in Iceland, it would be nearly impossible to miss the
	<a href="https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/hallgrimskirkja" target="_blank">
	Hallgrímskirkja Church</a>. It is the second tallest building in all of Iceland. Beyond that,
	its architecture is very unique with its curved spire that somewhat resembles the basalt columns
	you may see at the Black Sand Beach.

	<strong>Alex's Atlas Travel Insights:</strong>
	<br>
	If you are looking to visit other iconic churches, consider a trip to France where
	you can see <a href=france.html#notredame>Notre Dame</a> and the <a href=france.html#basilique>Basilique du Sacré Coeur</a>.
