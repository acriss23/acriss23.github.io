<h2 class="center">Ireland</h2>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/irelandmap.jpg" alt="map of Ireland" title="map of Ireland"><p>Ireland, also known as the "Emerald Isle", is a beautiful country to visit.
	Among all of the greenery, you will also find a number of castles. Starting in the
	capital city of Dublin, you could rent a car to take a road trip out to many of the
	castles. Some of them include: Kilkenny Castle, Cahir Castle, and Blarney Castle
	(home of the famous Blarney Stone). If you're from the USA like me, be careful if you
	rent a car - you would need to drive on the left side of the road and some of the
	country roads can be extremely narrow. If you are concerned about driving, bus tours
	may be a safer (and more convenient) route.

	<strong>Alex's Atlas Travel Insights:</strong>
	<br>
	Reykjavik, Iceland is only a 2.5 hour flight from Dublin, Ireland. If you are
	looking to explore more of the world during your trip, consider adding a
	<a href=iceland.html>trip to Iceland</a> to your itinerary.

<h3 class="center" id="cliffs"><span>Cliffs of Moher</span><span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/cliffsofmoher1.jpg" alt="Cliffs of Moher branching out into the sea" title="Cliffs of Moher"><p>The <a href="https://www.cliffsofmoher.ie/" target="_blank">
	Cliffs of Moher</a> is a must-see landscape in Ireland. The cliffs, which branch out
	into the sea, are contrasted with the surrounding farm land. Like many other
	landmarks, the Cliffs can also be seen in films like "The Princess Bride" and
	"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince." While it may take a few hours to drive
	from Dublin out to the cliffs, it is well worth it. You may be able to find a
	bus tour that will guide the way for you, such as
	<a href="https://www.paddywagontours.com/CLIFFS-OF-MOHER-Day-Tour-From-DUBLIN" target="_blank">
	Paddywagon's Cliffs of Moher Tour</a>.</p></div>

<h3 class="center" id="giants">Giant's Causeway<span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/giantscauseway2.jpg" alt="basalt columns at Giant's Causeway" title="basalt columns at Giant's Causeway"><p>Giant's Causeway is a geological wonder in Northern Ireland, and as such, is also
	a UNESCO world heritage site. It comprises thousands of basalt columns formed as a
	result of volcanic eruptions. This site can be visited as part of a bus tour that starts
	in Dublin, Ireland, such as
	<a href="https://www.finnmccoolstours.com/giants-causeway-tour-from-dublin/" target="_blank">
	Finn McCools' Giant's Causeway Tour</a>.</p></div>
	
<h3 class="center" id="kerry">Ring of Kerry<span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/kerry3.jpg" alt="old cottage with sea and mountains behind it" title="Ring of Kerry scenic drive"><p>The Ring of Kerry is a scenic drive that takes you through beautiful pastures
	and villages to get a sense of what Ireland's countryside is like. A typical bus tour, such as
	<a href="https://www.paddywagontours.com/RING-OF-KERRY-Day-Tour-From-CORK" target="_blank">
	Paddywagon's Ring of Kerry Tour</a>, will take you from Cork, to Killarney, Killorglin, Dingle Bay, Waterville,
	Sneem, Killarney National Park, and Torc Waterfall.</p></div>
	
<h3 class="center" id="guinness">Guinness Storehouse<span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/guinness1.jpg" alt="Guinness Storehouse gate" title="Guinness Storehouse gate"><p>At the <a href="https://www.guinness-storehouse.com/en" target="_blank">
	Guinness Storehouse</a> in Dublin, you can learn about the history of Guinness
	in Ireland. You can tour the brewery, learn to pour the perfect pint, and relax
	on the fourth floor of the Guinness Storehouse.</p></div>

<h3 class="center" id="gaol">Kilmainham Gaol<span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/kilmainham1.jpg" alt="inside Kilmainham Gaol" title="Kilmainham Gaol"><p><a href="https://kilmainhamgaolmuseum.ie/" target="_blank">
	Kilmainham Gaol</a> is a former prison turned museum in Dublin. It was active
	from 1796 through 1924. The building is eerie to witness in person through a
	guided tour; however, it is a great opportunity to learn about the history in
	Ireland and the many war prisoners who were detained during its operation. The 
	museum provides many educational opportunities, including providing an
	<a href="https://kilmainhamgaolmuseum.ie/online-tour/" target="_blank">
	online Kilmainham Gaol tour</a> if you prefer to experience it that way.</p></div>
