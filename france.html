<h2 class="center">France</h2>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/francemap.jpg" alt="map of France" title="map of France"><p>France is known for its art, fashion, food, wine, and many identifiable monuments.
	Many memorable activities can be done in its capital city of Paris. I visited during
	the month of July and the weather at that time was perfect - around 70° during the day.
	Signing up for a walking tour is an efficient way to explore the city on foot with an
	experienced guide. Many of these walking tours should be reserved in advance and are
	free with a recommended donation to your guide.</p></div>

<h3 class="center" id="eiffel"><span>The Eiffel Tower</span><span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/eiffeltower1.jpg" alt="the Eiffel Tower" title="the Eiffel Tower"><p>The <a href="https://www.toureiffel.paris/en" target="_blank">Eiffel Tower</a> may be one of the first monuments you envision when someone
	mentions France. If you are staying within Paris, it shouldn't be a challenge to spot
	it. Be sure to look out for it at night as it lights up the city. In the evening, it
	also presents a sparkling light show for five minutes at the top of each hour. If the
	timing aligns for you, you may also be lucky to catch fireworks on Bastille Day, July 14.
	It is also worth it to buy an <a href="https://www.toureiffel.paris/en/rates-opening-timesget" target="_blank">
	Eiffel Tower ticket</a> to ride the elevator to the top, where you can get breathtaking views
	of the city.</p></div>

<h3 class="center" id="louvre">The Louvre Museum<span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/louvre.jpg" alt="Louvre Museum building" title="Louvre Museum building"><p>The <a href="https://www.louvre.fr/en" target="_blank">Louvre Museum</a> in Paris houses many of the world's most famous pieces of art,
	including the Mona Lisa. The building itself is also an artistic landmark itself and
	has made appearances in a number of films. Bastille Day, July 14, is a great day to
	visit as the museum is open and free of charge due to the national holiday.</p></div>

<h3 class="center" id="versailles">Palace of Versailles<span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/versailles1.jpg" alt="Palace of Versailles building" title="Palace of Versailles building"><p>The <a href="https://en.chateauversailles.fr/" target="_blank">Palace of Versailles</a>
	is another French landmark. Formerly the residence of King Louis XIII, it was constructed
	in the 1600's. It was during the 1800's that it became a museum, where visitors can explore
	the palace and its surrounding estate, including the garden with its miraculous fountains and
	shrubbery. The palace itself is now a museum that houses thousands of pieces of art work. Purchasing a
	<a href="https://en.chateauversailles.fr/plan-your-visit/tickets-and-prices" target="_blank">
	Palace of Versailles ticket</a> would allow you to see how royalty lived in the 1600's in France.</p></div>

<h3 class="center" id="notredame">Notre Dame<span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/notredame.jpg" alt="Notre Dame building" title="Notre Dame building"><p><a href="https://notredamecathedralparis.com/" target="_blank">Notre Dame</a>
	is an active Catholic cathedral in Paris that was constructed in 1345. Like the
	Eiffel Tower, it is a very recognizable landmark in Paris, with appearances in
	a number of films. Unfortunately, the cathedral caught fire in 2019 and is
	undergoing reconstruction that is not expected to be completed until after 2024.
	When it reopens to the public, it would  be worthwhile to visit and check out available
	times to climb the towers.

<h3 class="center" id="basilique">Basilique du Sacré Coeur<span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/basilique.jpg" alt="Basilique du Sacré Coeur building" title="Basilique du Sacré Coeur building"><p>The <a href="https://www.sacre-coeur-montmartre.com/english/" target="_blank">
	Basilique du Sacré Coeur</a> is an active Roman Catholic church in Paris. It exhibits
	stunning architecture and stained glass windows. It is located at the highest point
	in the city at Montmartre, and as such, is also known as a good vantage point to view
	the city.
