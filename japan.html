<h2 class="center">Japan</h2>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/japanmap.jpg" alt="map of Japan" title="map of Japan"><p>Japan is a beautiful island country off the coast of East Asia. Many visitors
	travel to Japan in the spring, around March and April, to experienc cherry
	blossoms in bloom. For more adventurous travelers, July and August are good times
	to visit to be able to hike to the top of Mount Fuji.
	<br><br>
	Japan is also home to the most populated city in the world - Tokyo. With such a
	large population, it is no surprise that Japan has a great metro system, including
	the well-known bullet train (Shinkansen) that can travel up to almost 200mph. As
	a tourist in Japan, an efficient and cost-effective way to utilize the railways is through the advanced
	purchase of the <a href="https://japanrailpass.net/en/" target="_blank">
	Japan Rail Pass</a> (JR Pass).</p></div>

<h3 class="center" id="bamboo"><span>Arashiyama Bamboo Grove</span><span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/bamboogrove.jpg" alt="looking up through the bamboo forest" title="bamboo forest"><p>As the name suggests, the <a href="https://www.insidekyoto.com/arashiyama-bamboo-grove" target="_blank">
	Arashiyama Bamboo Grove</a> is a forest with towering
	bamboo overhead. You can walk through the paths of the forest to take in the gentle
	sounds of the bamboo swaying in the wind. To visit the bamboo grove, you can take
	the JR line from Kyoto Station to Saga-Arashiyama Station. From  there, it is
	a quaint 15 minute stroll through the town to get to the entrance of the bamboo
	grove.</p></div>

<h3 class="center" id="ghibli">Ghibli Museum<span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/ghiblimuseum.jpg" alt="Ghibli Museum building" title="Ghibli Museum building"><p><a href="https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/" target="_blank">Ghibli Museum</a> in
	Mitaka is a museum centered around the works of Hayao Miyazaki, who animated a
	number of films through his animation studio, Studio Ghibli. Some of these films
	include "My Neighbor Totoro," "Kiki's Delivery Service," and "Spirited Away."
	This is a must-see for any fans of Studio Ghibli films, where you can learn about
	the film animation process, see some of Miyazaki's sketches, and more.
	Note that <a href="https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/tickets/" target="_blank">
	Ghibli Museum tickets</a> must be reserved in advance.</p></div>
	
<h3 class="center" id="kinkakuji">Kinkakuji<span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/kinkakuji.jpg" alt="Kinkakuji, Golden Pavilion" title="Kinkakuji, Golden Pavilion"><p><a href="https://www.shokoku-ji.jp/en/kinkakuji/about/" target="_blank">
	Kinkaku-ji</a> is a Buddhist temple and World Heritage site in Kyoto. In English,
	it is known as the "Golden Pavilion" due to the gold-leaf coating on the building.
	While the temple dates back to the 1300's, the current building was reconstructed
	in 1955 after a fire occured at the property. While it is breathtaking to see in
	person, there is also an option to do a <a href="https://www.shokoku-ji.jp/en/kinkakuji/guide/" target="_blank">
	virtual Kinkaku-ji tour</a>.</p></div>
	
<h3 class="center" id="fuji">Mount Fuji<span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/fuji3.jpg" alt="sign at the entrance to the Mount Fuji hike" title="entrance to the Mount Fuji hike"><p>Mount Fuji is the tallest peak in Japan, at 3,776 meters. It is only open to
	hikers in July and August due to dangerous climbing conditions outside of that
	timeframe. You can check the <a href="http://www.fujisan-climb.jp/en/index.html" target="_blank">
	Official Web Site for Mount Fuji Climbing</a> for advisories and other information before you take off on your trip.
	Some hikers choose to climb to the top and back down in one day, while others may reserve space at the
	lodge near the top of the mountain to rest until just before sunrise. A couple hours
	before sunrise, they pack up and hike the rest of the way to the peak to see the
	sunrise from the top of Mount Fuji.

<h3 class="center" id="daibutsu">Kamakura Daibutsu<span class="right"><a href=#top>To Top</a></span></h3>

	<div class="float"><img src="img/daibutsu.jpg" alt="Kamakura Daibutstu" title="Kamakura Daibutstu"><p>Kamakura Daibutsu, or "The Great Buddha of Kamakura," is a large, bronze statue of
	Amida Buddha that was created in 1252. Including its base, it stands at over 13
	meters tall. The statue is hollow, so it is possible to line up behind the statue
	for a chance to see its interior.</p></div>
